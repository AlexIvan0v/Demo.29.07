        Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest
        Now is the time that face should form another;
        Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
        Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.

        Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
        Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
        Of his self-love, to stop posterity?
        Thou art thy mother’s glass, and she in thee
        Calls back the lovely April of her prime:
        So thou through windows of thine age shall see
        Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
        But if thou live, remember’d not to be,
